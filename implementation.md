# Implementation Log

## 2025-01-03 - Website Restructuring

### Changes Made:
1. **Created `/supe` directory** - Created a new subdirectory to house the SUPE research paper website
2. **Moved SUPE research content** - Moved the original `index.html` (containing the full SUPE research paper website) to `supe/index.html`
3. **Created new root landing page** - Created a new simple `index.html` at the root with:
   - Clean, modern design with gradient background
   - Personal welcome message: "Hi, this is Max Wilcoxson's personal website"
   - Navigation links to SUPE research, GitHub, and Google Scholar
   - Responsive design for mobile devices

### File Structure After Changes:
```
/
├── index.html (new simple landing page)
├── supe/
│   └── index.html (moved SUPE research paper website)
├── static/ (unchanged)
├── implementation.md (this file)
└── README.md (unchanged)
```

### Website Navigation:
- Root (`/`) - Personal landing page
- `/supe` - SUPE research paper website

## 2025-01-03 - Fixed SUPE Website Asset Paths

### Issue:
After moving the SUPE research paper website to `/supe/index.html`, all CSS, JavaScript, and image assets were broken because the relative paths were incorrect.

### Changes Made:
1. **CSS Files** - Updated all CSS links from `./static/css/` to `../static/css/`:
   - `bulma.min.css`
   - `bulma-carousel.min.css`
   - `bulma-slider.min.css`
   - `fontawesome.all.min.css`
   - `index.css`

2. **JavaScript Files** - Updated all JS links from `./static/js/` to `../static/js/`:
   - `fontawesome.all.min.js`
   - `bulma-carousel.min.js`
   - `bulma-slider.min.js`
   - `index.js`

3. **Images and Videos** - Updated all media paths from `static/images/` to `../static/images/`:
   - Video files: `explore_anim.mp4`, `traj_skills_anim.mp4`, `supe_anim.mp4`
   - Method graphics: `supe_method_graphic.png`, `temp_uncorrelated_website.png`, `skill-figure-website.png`, `pessimistic_reward_website.png`
   - Animation frames: All 5 optimistic exploration images
   - Results charts: `supe-results-agg.png`, `antmaze-goal-time-new3.png`

### Result:
The SUPE research paper website at `/supe` now displays correctly with all styling, animations, and images working properly.
